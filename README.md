## What is the Transfer Matrix Method?
TMM computes the light propagation through a stack of flat layers of different materials, each of which is described by its thickness, index of refraction, and possibly also by the absorption coefficient. These parameters are represented by a 2x2 matrices arranged in such a way that the behaviour of the whole stack can be computed by simple matrix multiplication.

It is therefore useful for the design of dielectric mirrors, filters, anti-reflex layers, as well for analysis of experimental spectroscopic data of thin layers which are often burdened by Fabry-PÃ©rot oscillations.

TMM can be considered an analytic method, since the multiplication of 2x2 matrices yields a closed analytic expression for the reflectance and transmittance structure. But rather it is 'semi'-analytic, since for a higher number of layers this expression becomes complex beyond the capabilities of a human. The numerical computation is, however, usually extremely fast. 

Note that a similar numerical approach of 2x2 matrices multiplication is used also for different problems in physics - one example is the computation of paraxial optics where the matrices represent lenses, air gaps, curved mirrors and other optical elements, but this kind of computation is not covered here.

## Usage

## Examples
#### Dielectric mirror bandwidth
A photonic band-gap forms for a periodic stack of dielectric bilayers. The central frequency is determined by the optical thickness of the bilayer. 

In contrast, its spectral width depends mostly on the reflectance from the 1-2 and 2-1 interfaces:

(Some maths will be added here - Work in progress)

#### Oblique incidence on an interface with given permittivity
Transmittance amplitude differs for TE (left) and TM polarisations (right):

The corresponding phase gained through propagation also differs between TE and TM. Note that TE polarisation exhibits an abrupt change of transmittance phase at the dielectric-metallic  transition, although the amplitude remains nonzero.
